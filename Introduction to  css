WHAT IS CSS?
CSS is "Cascading Style Sheets", a cornerstone web technology used with HTML.  It allows for very discrete, or alternatively, system-wide customization (and everywhere in between) to the look-and-feel elements of web pages.  It is a very powerful tool to tailor the look and feel of your community to your liking.  It is, however, a little more technical in that it requires that it be written like code (like html) and, if executed improperly, can ultimately affect more than intended.  (It should be used carefully.)

(See the wikipedia entry for CSS for more details.)

WHAT IS IT GOOD FOR?
CSS can be used when you want fine-grained control over the appearance and behaviors of the graphical elements in your community.  Using CSS is considered web design - having experience with HTML and CSS would help greatly in understanding what is and is not in the scope of using CSS in VLab.

HOW DO I USE IT?
